## What is this project?

This project is called **Adidas Sales Analysis**. It uses Power BI to look at Adidas sales data and help the company make better decisions. We want to understand sales trends, profits, and what’s working well, so Adidas can grow and do better in the sports industry.

The project has a Power BI dashboard with charts to show sales in a clear way.

## What are we trying to solve?

We focus on these main points (called KPIs):

1. **Total Sales**: See how much Adidas sells over time.
2. **Profit**: Check how much money Adidas makes from sales in different areas.
3. **Sales Volume**: Look at how many items Adidas sells to understand what people want.
4. **Pricing**: Find the average price of items to see if the pricing is good.
5. **Margin**: Check the average profit margin to see how much money Adidas keeps from sales.

## Why does this matter?

This project helps Adidas by:

- Understanding what drives sales and how to improve.
- Finding areas where sales are high or low.
- Learning which products sell well to help with stock and marketing.
- Making better pricing and profit plans.
- Giving ideas to increase sales and profits in different ways.

## About the Data

This project uses a dataset called `adidas_sales_data.csv`. It has sales information for Adidas products sold by different stores. Here’s what the data includes:

- **Retailer**: The store selling the product (like Foot Locker, Walmart, etc.).
- **Retailer ID**: A number to identify the store.
- **Invoice Date**: The date of the sale (in a number format, like 43831, which is a date in Excel).
- **Region**: The area where the sale happened (like Northeast, South, West).
- **State**: The state where the sale happened (like New York, Texas, California).
- **City**: The city where the sale happened (like New York, Houston, San Francisco).
- **Product**: The type of product sold (like Men's Street Footwear, Women's Apparel).
- **Price per Unit**: How much one item costs.
- **Units Sold**: How many items were sold.
- **Total Sales**: The total money made from the sale (Price per Unit × Units Sold).
- **Operating Profit**: The profit made after costs.
- **Operating Margin**: The profit percentage (Operating Profit ÷ Total Sales).
- **Sales Method**: How the product was sold (like In-store or Outlet).

The data covers sales from different stores, regions, and products, which helps us make the charts in Power BI.

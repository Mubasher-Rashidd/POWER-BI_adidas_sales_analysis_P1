## What is this project?

This project is called **Adidas Sales Analysis**. It uses Power BI to look at Adidas sales data and help the company make better decisions. We want to understand sales trends, profits, and whatâ€™s working well, so Adidas can grow and do better in the sports industry.

The project has a Power BI dashboard with charts to show sales in a clear way.

## What are we trying to solve?

We focus on these main points (called KPIs):

1. **Total Sales**: See how much Adidas sells over time.
2. **Profit**: Check how much money Adidas makes from sales in different areas.
3. **Sales Volume**: Look at how many items Adidas sells to understand what people want.
4. **Pricing**: Find the average price of items to see if the pricing is good.
5. **Margin**: Check the average profit margin to see how much money Adidas keeps from sales.

## Why does this matter?

This project helps Adidas by:

- Understanding what drives sales and how to improve.
- Finding areas where sales are high or low.
- Learning which products sell well to help with stock and marketing.
- Making better pricing and profit plans.
- Giving ideas to increase sales and profits in different ways.
